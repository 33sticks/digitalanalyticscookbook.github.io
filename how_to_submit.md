# How To Submit An Article

### Option 1: GitHub
Submissions will be accepted via GitHub, using [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax). If you are already familiar with GitHub, this option will provide direct access to the [Digital Analytics Cookbook](http://digitalanalyticscookbook.org) to not only submit articles but to submit suggested changes to the overall site content and structure.

The first thing you will want to do is Fork a copy of the [Digital Analytics Cookbook](https://github.com/digitalanalyticscookbook/digitalanalyticscookbook.github.io) to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

Next, you will want to create a new article file, utilizing the article template Markdown file found in the root directory.

Add all your content to a new branch, proofread your work, and commit changes to your repository.

Finally, to get the article published in the cookbook, simply submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).


### Option 2: Email

If submitting articles through GitHub seems a bit daunting, don't worry, you can still contribute by submitting your articles via email.

In order to reduce editing and publishing time, we recommend that all articles are submitted using [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links).

There are many free Markdown editors you can access directly via a web browser:

* [(GitHub-Flavored) Markdown Editor](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/)
* [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/)
* [Stack Edit](https://stackedit.io/)

Add all your content, proofread your work, and save your changes in a text file with the filename: change_to_your_article_name.md

Email your article as an attachment to: [digitalanalyticscookbook@gmail.com](mailto:digitalanalyticscookbook@gmail.com)
